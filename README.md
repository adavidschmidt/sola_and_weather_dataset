Create a dataset for future analysis and modeling to predict solar energy output

This is a personal project. The goals of the project were to create and clean a dataset that I can use for future analysis and review of my personal solar production.

Data sources:
Weather data was sourced from the National Center for Environmental Information (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/lcd) with my location.
Solar data was sourced through my solar micro-inverter provider (Enphase Energy)

Key features of the project:
1. Using Pandas library
2. Confirming the datatypes of the dataset's columns
3. Cleaning and transforming the data
4. Joining datasets
5. Creating a final dataset with only columns needed for analysis
